VR Developer Nanodegree - Project 4 (Puzzler)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the puzzler project of the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree.

Itâ€™s focused more on design process considerations that should be followed in order to generate a nice experience in VR. 

The project is about person who is in a desert creepy dungeon and finds a puzzle that needs to be solved to escape this dungeon. There should be a big room with flashing orbs that the user should click on in the same flashing order to unlock the door and escape.
