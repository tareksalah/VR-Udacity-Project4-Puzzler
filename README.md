VR Nanodegree Course - Project 4 (Puzzler)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the puzzler project of the Udacity VR Developer Nanodegree.

It's simply about creating practicing several design considerations in VR through an interactive puzzler game.

The scene is within a dungeoun, where a set of orbs flash in a certain order. The player needs to click on the orbs in the same order in order to be able to escape the dungeon.
